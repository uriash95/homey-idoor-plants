     <h2 class="h2">who are we?</h2>
     <p class="p"> we are an online and on site high quality indoor plants shop. we are active since 2018. on 2020 after our shop was closed duo to covid 19 pandemic we have desided to open our first online shop. since than we realised that on the online platform we can give you a better service, reach out to more costumers and grow much better and faster. dont worry! the fact we are growing is better for you! as we have more employee's we can manege to give you a faster delivery's and much personal and better service.
        in our shop we sell very rare indoor plants. most of our plants are very good in cleaning the air in the house and produce more oxigen. how does it work?
        here is the answer for you: Plants need three main ingredients to make their food: water, carbon dioxide and sunlight. Plants take up the water that they need from the soil through their roots. Carbon dioxide is a gas found in the air; plants can take in this gas through tiny holes in their leaves. Once they have water and carbon dioxide, they can use energy from sunlight to make their food. The leftovers from making the plant food is another gas called oxygen. This oxygen is released from the leaves into the air. 
     </p>
     <p>Take a look at the picture below to see this system in action:</p>

    </section>
    <p>This leftover oxygen is really important because humans and other animals need this oxygen to live which we breathe in from the air.  When we breathe out, we release carbon dioxide into the air which is then used by the plants to make their food and the cycle starts all over again. This system is called the oxygen cycle.</p>
    <p>more than making your house produce more oxigen, a very big part of our service is to help you design and orginize your plants on the best way. some of the plants need more light, some less, some need more humidity. we help you to scale and place any plant in his best locaition for thriving. we also advice you how much water to give them, how often, and so on... our goal is to make every house greener, more breathable, and much more beautiful.
